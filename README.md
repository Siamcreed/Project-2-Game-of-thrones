# Build process
Day 1: I worked on extracting the data out the Api, which was easy but I ran into a problem. The problem was that in the console I could render all the characters in the console but not in the browser.

Day 2: I made a component to render the character and the features called mainpage. I also started setting up the root pages so I could navigate through the components easily.

Day 3: On day 3 I had trouble adding functions to the characters so I made another component that would allow me to add an item to the list. Initailly it was not functional but later it was functional. I then rendered it in the mainpage so I could add the item to the list.

Day 4: I added extra features to the code that allowed me to edit and delete the item, and because of this I was able to add extra fucntions to the mainpage that allowed me to select and delete specfic Items and delete all. I also worked on the CSS to make the page look better.

Day 5: I finished the routes for the app and tested the app. I ran into some bugs but I debugged them.
